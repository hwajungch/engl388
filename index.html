    <h1>Hello, English 388</h1>
    <p>My name is Hwa Jung Choi and I go by they/them pronouns.
      I am an undergraduate student at the University of Washington,
      majoring in Human Centered Design & Engineering (HCDE) with a focus in Human Computer Interaction (HCI).
      I enjoy the human centered approach to problem solving and the emphasis on data-informed decision-making.
      I am also pursuing a Business minor since I believe it is an important domain to understand in order to communicate well with professional stakeholders.
      My passion is in UX writing and technical communication in particular. Thus, I aim to design inclusive and intuitive digital experiences through words.
      Currently, my skillset includes design thinking, human centered design, mixed methods research in UX, and communication.
      I also know some basic HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, and Java.
