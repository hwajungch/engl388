    <h1>Favorite Foods</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>I love food.</strong> A good bowl of fried rice can brighten up my day. I lvoe a nice hot soup to warm me up.
      But most importantly, I love comfort food. The food that I grew up eating whenever I was sick or having a bad day.
      As a Korean, I also eat side dishes (banchan)... but that doesn't count. If it did, this list would be too long.

    <h1>Favorite Bands</h1>
    <p>
      I am the type of person who hears a song they like, then listens to it for months until they get bored.
      So most of the time, I don't follow or <em>stan</em> specific bands. Instead, I listen to songs in a similar style.
      However, there are some bands where I will listen to all or the majority of their songs.
      Thus, these are my favorite bands in the sense that I actually try to keep up with their discography.
