    <h1>Interesting Wiki Article: Sincerity</h1>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sincerity">Sincerity</a> is a well-known virtue.
      There's nothing too special about that. However, the origin of the word is interesting and surrounded in controversy.
      The Oxford English Dictionary says that it comes from the Latin word <em>sincerus</em> which means clean or pure.
      Some believe that it comes from the two Latin words, <em>sine (without)</em> and <em>cera (wax)</em>.
      The story is that fraudulant sculpters would use wax to hide their mistakes. So, the statues made "without wax" were genuine.
      While this etymology is hotly debated by scholars, it's my personal favorite ever since I first read about it in Dan Brown's novel, <em>Digital Fortress</em>.
    </p>
    <p>Since then, I replaced "sincerely" with "without wax" in emails with friends. It was a fun, semi-inside joke and it made us feel smart,
      just like this adorable pug that looks absolutely dapper with its glasses and sweater on.

    <p>On an unrelated note, my favorite musician is Bibi.
